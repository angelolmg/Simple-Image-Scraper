# C#_Single-Image-Scraper

[01/28/20] 
A simple google image web scrapper made with C#. Just write the names of the subjects to search in the "subjects.txt" and compile.

Before usage, it's nedded to update locations on the Main function, or else it won't work.

This can be modified to download more images at a time, but no more than 20, in my experience.

The HTML for the image search engine changes... so this exact code could eventually break, be advised. 

Inspired by user Icemanind, on StackOverflow.
